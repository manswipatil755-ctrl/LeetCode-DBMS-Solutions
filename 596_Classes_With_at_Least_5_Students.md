596. Classes With at Least 5 Students
 
 Table: Courses

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| student     | varchar |
| class       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
(student, class) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of a student and the class in which they are enrolled.
 

Write a solution to find all the classes that have at least five students.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 ## Approach

 1. Group all the Data using GROUP BY 
 2. Use COUNT to count student per class
 3. use HAVING to filter the data

 ## CODE 

```MYSQL

 SELECT class
FROM Courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(student) >= 5
;

```
